We are going to create a Shape interface and concrete classes implementing the Shape interface. A factory class ShapeFactory is defined as a next step.
FactoryPatternDemo, our demo class, will use ShapeFactory to get a Shape object. It will pass information (CIRCLE / RECTANGLE / SQUARE) to ShapeFactory to get the type of object it needs.
