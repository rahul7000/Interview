We are going to create an abstract class Shape and concrete classes extending the Shape class. A class ShapeCache is defined as a next step which stores shape objects in a Hashtable and returns their clone when requested.
PrototypePatternDemo, our demo class, will use ShapeCache class to get a Shape object.
